# Sudoku
Sudoku game - In progress

More features to come including:
1) The ability to select difficulties
2) Start a New Game (shouldn't that be one of the first things you add?)
3) Select Color Schemes!
4) Different size boards 8)
5) SEVERAL bug fixes
6) A timer
7) High scores

This is pretty much the barebones framework of this game. The code needs to be cleaned up but it's pretty much playable right now. The algorithms used were described in a paper called Sudoku Puzzles Generating: from Easy to Evil. It can be accessed at this link:http://zhangroup.aporc.org/images/files/Paper_3485.pdf
